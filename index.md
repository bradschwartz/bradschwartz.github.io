# Experience 

## [Capital One - Data Engineer](https://www.capitalone.com/)

Currently a data engineer at Capital One, focusing on bringing DevOps best practices to legacy teams. I've achieved large cost-savings and faster development cycles by automating infrastructure and and code deployments. A big portion of my development work is centered around utilizing Apache Spark on AWS EMRs for creating regulatory reports. Also an active contributor to [inner-soruced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_source) projects, including as a core maintainer of an internal Homebrew tap, easing distribution of development tools.

## [Western Digital  - Big Data Intern](https://www.westerndigital.com/)

During the 2017 Summer, I interned at Western Digital on their Big Data Platform, working on projects for better cloud-resource tracking, automation at scale, and containerization projects.

## [Research]()

I was heavily involved with mathematical and numerical research, particularly on a modern version of the Procrustes Problem. Alongside Dr. Steven Damelin, I worked on creating a point-set matching algorithm based off his papers with Dr. Charles Fefferman.

## [ATLAS Collaboration](https://home.cern/)

I previously worked on the ATLAS detector on the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva through the University of Michigan's Physics department. My responsibilities focused on analysis of data reconstruction and leveraging CERN-specific toolkits for measuring detector performance.
