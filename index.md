# Experience

## [Embark Trucks - Software Engineer, Developer Experience](https://embarktrucks.com/)

At Embark Trucks, I was a software engineer on the developer experience team, tasked
with ensuring all the systems all the product-facing engineers relied upon
were running smoothly. My main project was focused on moving the legacy Jenkins
infrastructure based on static EC2s over to auto-scaling and ephemeral Kubernetes
pods. This was projected to save 30% of our related cloud spend and reduce
maintainence toil.

We partnered heavily with our cloud infrastructure and data teams, where I got hands-on
experience with Kubernetes management, Terraform state migrations, and what it means
to manage actual hardware on the roads.

## [Capital One - Software Engineer](https://www.capitalone.com/)

Previously, a DevOps-focused software engineer at Capital One, focusing on bringing best
practices to legacy teams. I've achieved large cost-savings and faster development
cycles by automating infrastructure and and code deployments. A big portion of my
development work is centered around building out CI/CD pipelines, enabling
teams to build and deploy their applications as seamlessly as possible. I'm a big
proponent of [InnerSourcing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_source), and
spend a portion of my days contributing to internal dev tools and maintaining our
Homebrew tap.

## [Western Digital  - Big Data Intern](https://www.westerndigital.com/)

During the 2017 Summer, I interned at Western Digital on their Big Data Platform,
working on projects for better cloud-resource tracking, automation at scale,
and containerization projects.

## [Research]()

I was heavily involved with mathematical and numerical research, particularly on
a modern version of the Procrustes Problem. Alongside Dr. Steven Damelin, I worked
on creating a point-set matching algorithm based off his papers with Dr. Charles Fefferman.

## [ATLAS Collaboration](https://home.cern/)

I previously worked on the ATLAS detector on the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva
through the University of Michigan's Physics department. My responsibilities
focused on analysis of data reconstruction and leveraging CERN-specific toolkits
for measuring detector performance.
